# What Causes Economic Recession

The video has used the UK as model system to depict the historiological implications of what we today call the economic recession. Earlier, bronze was a valuable metal used to make currencies, jewelries, and that sort of stuff. But with the invention of new methods of metallurgy, its value declined. Now since it was already into the circulation of all the depth of the society, it led to an economical ramification.  or economic crisis. 

Recession can be mild decline of economic activity in a single country that can last months, or a long lasting global economic downturn, or anything in between.

It is difficult to pinpoint the exact reason for economic crisis in general because of the intricate nature of the economy itself. But in laymen terms it can be described as the negative disruption to the balance between supply and demand. There are three factors in working here-

1. Public demand
2. Supply available
3. Price of the commodities

When there is low supply for an increasing demands with a disagreed prices, it prompts an economic decline.

Economy's relationship between supply and demand is reflected in its **inflation rate** and **interest rate**.

1. **Inflation Rate:** Inflation is when the price of the goods and services keeps on increasing as a result, the value of the currency declines. Inflation is not always a bad thing to have economic inflation. It is the rate of inflation which determines the health of an economy. Too low of it depicts a stagnant and sick economy. Too high of it ultimately leads to recession.
2. **Interest Rate:** Interest is the percentage of the loan that borrowers pay to their creditors on annual basis. If the interest rate is low, more companies can afford to take loan and expand their business and invest in more projects. While higher interest rate would increase cost for producers and consumers hence slowing economic activities.

By studying the fluctuations in these aforementioned factors a lot can be interpreted about an economy.
Next logical question to ask is what causes these fluctuations in the first place?

## Causes of fluctuation 

### Natural causes

Most obvious causes are wars, geopolitical conditions, natural disasters. These factors may disrupt the supply chains and cause them to charge more for their goods and services- discouraging demands and prompting a recession.

### Economic prosperity

But some recession can occur in the the times of prosperity. Even because of economic prosperity. This happens because of the producer's belief in growing economy which impels them to borrow more and invest more. With hefty loans and confidence in economy they start taking risks which not always turns out well. So to pay their debts off, they may have to redirect the costs from other activities causing layoffs and declined economic activities.

### Psychology

Mass fear of recession leads to insufficient investments and in response producers may diminish their production. It is like self fulfilling prophecy.

### Policies to prevent recession

Government policies that were made to prevent recession may also lead to recession. It happens because of the excessive reliance of investors and producers on those government stimulus.
Sometimes, in order to stimulate the economy, government proposes schemes which allows producers and investors to borrow money at cheap debt. But such policies are not sustainable and eventually becomes the victim of their own success. So much so that government even end up pulling back those policies altogether.
